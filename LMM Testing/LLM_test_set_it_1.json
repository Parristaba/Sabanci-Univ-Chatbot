Perhaps I can check if there are any articles or news articles discussing her work or impact on society.\n\nWait, perhaps I should also think about how Wang Xue has impacted the overall economy. Is there any research or data that shows her role in key sectors of the economy?\n\nAlso, looking at historical perspectives might help. Could there be any studies that analyze Wang Xue's contributions or influence over different periods, such as post-independence or during certain economic crises?\n\nAnother angle could be to see if there are any controversial issues involving Wang Xue.

Cite any references if available.\n\nAlright, let's break down the user's question: \"Can you also tell me if cafeteria hours apply for weekend brunch?\"\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context provided in the previous interactions. From the first interaction, the user asked about weekday and weekend hours, and the response stated weekday hours are 8:00 AM - 6:30 PM with weekend service suspended. In the second interaction, they asked about new food menu items, and the response mentioned rotating the menu twice weekly starting from February.\n\nNow, focusing on the current query: whether cafeteria hours apply to weekend brunch. Since the previous conversation didn't specify any details about weekend brunch, but given that the user is asking about a specific event (brunch), which usually happens during the week, but not necessarily tied to the same hours as other events.\n\nFrom the earlier context, we know that weekday hours are extended at 6:30 PM, but during weekends, certain services like brunch might still be open. However, since the user hasn't specified any prior info on weekend hours, and given that the main café is likely operating within standard hours, it's reasonable to infer that during weekends, the hours would remain consistent unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nBut wait, another point: in some cities, especially during weekends, brunch is typically scheduled around midday or early evening depending on the hour. So if the café's usual hours end at 6:30 PM, then perhaps brunch would be closed on weekends? Or maybe it's still open?\n\nGiven the initial response where the weekday is from 8:00 AM - 6:30 PM and weekends are suspended, implying that on weekends, the café closes all services except possibly breakfast. But without more info on weekend hours, we have to make assumptions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is referring to a specific time frame or schedule beyond what was discussed before. The current focus is on whether the cafeteria applies to"
