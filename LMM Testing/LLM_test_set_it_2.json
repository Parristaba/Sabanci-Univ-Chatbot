Ensure that any citations are properly mentioned.\nOkay, so I need to figure out what the user is asking about regarding the library renovations and Wi-Fi upgrades at Sabancı University. Let me read through the provided documents again. \n\nFirst, there's a section about library renovations starting from June 2025. It mentions extensive renovations to improve study spaces and create new digital resource zones. That sounds like the library part. They're expanding areas and adding new resources, which could include more technology access. I should note that part under the library section.\n\nNext, there's information about Wi-Fi upgrades. The document states that campus-wide speeds will double after installation of 200+ new routers by September 2025. This means internet access across all buildings will be significantly better. I should mention this as well, making sure to highlight the completion date and number of routers.\n\nI don't see any conflicting information between the two sections. Both are happening simultaneously, which is good for the user's convenience and transparency. So, putting it together, the user asked about both library renovations and Wi-Fi upgrades, and each has its own details.\n\nWait, let me check if there's anything else missing. The documents talk about new digital resource zones specifically for the library, but the Wi-Fi upgrade doesn't mention the library per se. So, those are separate initiatives. I should present both facts separately in my response.\n\nAlso, since the user provided the exact times (June 2025 for library and September 2025 for Wi-Fi), I should specify those dates clearly. Maybe add brief descriptions of each to give more context.\n\nSo, summarizing, the user wants to know about the library renovations and the corresponding Wi-Fi improvements. Each has distinct details, so providing them separately makes sense. I'll structure the answer to cover both aspects with clear points, ensuring the user can understand each improvement without confusion.\n\nI think that's all the necessary information from"
